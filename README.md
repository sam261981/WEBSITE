# Intro to HTML and CSS

## Task 1: create a profile in HTML

Create a profile of a character of your choosing (or even yourself). Your HTML document will need:

- a main element
- a level-1 heading
- one or more level-2 or lower headings
- one or more paragraphs
- an unordered list
- an ordered list
- an internal link
- an external link that opens in the current tab
- an external link that opens in a new tab

## Task 2: decorate your profile with CSS

1. Set up your `.css` file
2. Link to your `.css` file in the `head` of your `.html` document
3. Style your profile any way you like!

Try to use each of the following CSS properties at least once:

- margin
- padding
- border
- border-radius
- font-family
- font-size
- background-color
- color
- text-align

Once you have applied these CSS properties, feel free to explore the many others at your disposal!

## Stretch goals

- centering: how would you centre the profile in the page?
- responsive design: how could you make this profile look good on both a desktop screen and a mobile device?
- deploy to Github Pages
